# A3-TTA
The repository is the official PyTorch implementation of the paper "A3-TTA: Adaptive Anchor Alignment Test-Time Adaptation for Medical Image Segmentation".


### TODO
- [ ] Upload the source model and the corresponding training code
- [ ] Implement multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods within a unified TTA framework
- [ ] Provide the core implementation of A3-TTA
